abstract: |
  Cidadão.AI is an innovative platform that uses specialized artificial intelligence
  to democratize access to Brazilian public data. The system employs a sophisticated
  multi-agent architecture to analyze government contracts, bidding processes, public
  expenses, and other government documents. It features eight specialized AI agents
  working collaboratively to detect anomalies, analyze patterns, and generate
  comprehensive reports, contributing directly to SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong
  Institutions. The platform provides both web interfaces (Gradio and Streamlit) and
  a REST API for programmatic access, making government transparency data accessible
  to citizens, journalists, researchers, and civil society organizations.
