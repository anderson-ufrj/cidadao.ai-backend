abstract: |
  Cidadão.AI Backend is an innovative platform that uses specialized artificial intelligence
  to democratize access to Brazilian public data. The system employs a sophisticated
  multi-agent architecture with 17 AI agents (each named after Brazilian historical figures)
  to analyze government contracts, bidding processes, public expenses, and other government
  documents. Features include anomaly detection, pattern analysis, report generation, and
  comprehensive transparency API integration, contributing directly to SDG 16: Peace, Justice
  and Strong Institutions. The platform provides a REST API for programmatic access, making
  government transparency data accessible to citizens, journalists, researchers, and civil
  society organizations.
