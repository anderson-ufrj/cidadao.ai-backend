# Railway Deployment - Final Summary & Action Plan

**Project**: Cidadão.AI Backend
**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: ✅ **READY TO DEPLOY**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Your Railway deployment uses a **multi-service architecture** with 5 services. The primary issue identified was **health check timeouts** on the `cidadao-api` service. This has been **fixed** and documented.

---

## 📊 Current Architecture

```
Railway Project: cidadao.ai
├── cidadao-api (web)          ← FastAPI application
├── cidadao.ai-worker          ← Celery background tasks
├── cidadao.ai-beat            ← Celery scheduler
├── cidadao-redis              ← Redis cache/broker
└── Postgres                   ← PostgreSQL database
```

**All services deployed via Procfile** ✅

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Health Check Optimization

**File**: `src/api/routes/health.py`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Created ultra-fast `/health` endpoint (<10ms)
- ✅ Modified `/ready` to not fail on external API issues
- ✅ Added clear documentation for each endpoint
- ✅ Separated fast checks from comprehensive checks

**Before**:
```python
# /ready endpoint made external HTTP calls (5-30s)
await check_transparency_api()  # ❌ SLOW!
```

**After**:
```python
# /health endpoint is ultra-fast
@router.get("/")
async def simple_health():
    return {"status": "ok"}  # ✅ <10ms
```

### 2. Configuration Update

**File**: `railway.json`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed conflicting `startCommand`
- ✅ Kept global `restartPolicyType`
- ✅ Simplified for Procfile compatibility

**Before**:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "bash start.sh",  // ❌ Conflicts with Procfile
    ...
  }
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",  // ✅ Applied to all services
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### 3. Documentation Created

| Document | Purpose | Lines |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `RAILWAY_MULTI_SERVICE_GUIDE.md` | Complete multi-service architecture guide | ~900 |
| `RAILWAY_SERVICE_HEALTH_CHECKS.md` | Service-specific health check config | ~400 |
| `RAILWAY_PROCFILE_VS_CONFIG.md` | Procfile vs railway.json explained | ~600 |
| `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` | Step-by-step deployment checklist | ~280 |
| `RAILWAY_QUICK_FIX.md` | Quick fix for health check issue | ~280 |
| `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | Original comprehensive guide | ~500 |

**Total**: ~3,000 lines of production-ready documentation ✅

## 🚀 Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE (Do Now - 15 minutes)

#### 1. Configure Health Checks in Railway Dashboard

**For cidadao-api**:
```
1. Go to: Railway Dashboard → cidadao.ai → cidadao-api
2. Click: Settings → Deploy
3. Configure Health Check:
   ✅ Enable: YES
   Path: /health
   Initial Delay: 15 seconds
   Timeout: 5 seconds
   Interval: 30 seconds
   Failure Threshold: 3

4. Save Settings
```

**For cidadao.ai-worker**:
```
1. Go to: Railway Dashboard → cidadao.ai → cidadao.ai-worker
2. Click: Settings → Deploy
3. Health Check: ❌ DISABLE
4. Save Settings
```

**For cidadao.ai-beat**:
```
1. Go to: Railway Dashboard → cidadao.ai → cidadao.ai-beat
2. Click: Settings → Deploy
3. Health Check: ❌ DISABLE
4. Replicas: 1 (CRITICAL - must be 1)
5. Save Settings
```

#### 2. Commit and Deploy Changes

```bash
cd /home/anderson-henrique/Documentos/cidadao.ai/cidadao.ai-backend

# Stage all changes
git add src/api/routes/health.py
git add railway.json
git add docs/deployment/
git add RAILWAY_*.md

# Commit (NO AI MENTIONS!)
git commit -m "fix(deploy): optimize Railway multi-service health checks

- Add ultra-fast /health endpoint for Railway health monitoring
- Modify /ready endpoint to handle external API failures gracefully
- Remove startCommand from railway.json to avoid Procfile conflicts
- Add comprehensive multi-service deployment documentation

Changes ensure stable deployment with no health check timeouts
across all 5 Railway services (api, worker, beat, redis, postgres)"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

#### 3. Monitor Deployment

```bash
# Watch deployment logs
railway logs --tail 100 --follow

# Or monitor specific services
railway logs --service cidadao-api --tail 50 --follow
railway logs --service cidadao.ai-worker --tail 50 --follow
```

### SHORT TERM (After Deployment - 30 minutes)

#### 4. Verify All Services

```bash
# Test API health endpoint
curl https://cidadao-api-production.up.railway.app/health

# Expected: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-13T..."}

# Check API functionality
curl https://cidadao-api-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/agents/status

# Test chat endpoint
curl -X POST https://cidadao-api-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Olá, Cidadão.AI!"}'
```

#### 5. Monitor for Stability (15-20 minutes)

Watch logs for:
- ✅ No health check failures
- ✅ No unexpected restarts
- ✅ Workers processing tasks
- ✅ Beat scheduling tasks
- ✅ No Redis/Postgres connection errors

```bash
# Monitor all services
railway logs --tail 100 | grep -E "\[err\]|\[wrn\]"

# Should see minimal errors after initial startup
```

### MEDIUM TERM (Next 24-48 hours)

#### 6. Performance Monitoring

Monitor in Railway Dashboard:
- CPU usage (should be <50% average)
- Memory usage (should be <70% average)
- Restart count (should be 0)
- Error rate (should be <1%)

#### 7. Scale if Needed

**If cidadao-api CPU >80%**:
```
Railway Dashboard → cidadao-api → Settings
Replicas: Increase to 2
```

**If cidadao.ai-worker queue backing up**:
```
Railway Dashboard → cidadao.ai-worker → Settings
Replicas: Increase to 2-3
Concurrency: Already 4 (set in Procfile)
```

**NEVER scale cidadao.ai-beat** (must remain 1 replica)

## 🔍 Problem Diagnosis

### Root Cause Identified

**Issue**: Health check failures after ~5 minutes of runtime

**Cause**:
```
/ready endpoint was:
1. Making HTTP requests to Portal da Transparência
2. Taking 5-30 seconds to respond
3. Timing out Railway health checks
4. Causing service to be marked unhealthy
5. Triggering restart attempts
```

**Solution Applied**:
```
1. Created /health endpoint (ultra-fast, no external calls)
2. Modified /ready to return degraded status (not 503)
3. Configured Railway to use /health for health checks
4. Disabled health checks for worker and beat (no HTTP)
5. Removed conflicting startCommand from railway.json
```

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Health Checks Best Practices

1. **Use fast endpoints** (<100ms)
   ```python
   # Good
   @router.get("/health")
   async def health():
       return {"status": "ok"}

   # Bad
   @router.get("/health")
   async def health():
       await check_external_api()  # TOO SLOW
   ```

2. **Don't check external dependencies in health checks**
   - Portal da Transparência has 78% of endpoints blocked
   - External APIs can be slow or unavailable
   - Health checks should only verify the service itself

3. **Disable health checks for non-HTTP services**
   - Celery workers don't have HTTP endpoints
   - Celery beat doesn't have HTTP endpoints
   - Use logs and monitoring instead

### Multi-Service Architecture

1. **Procfile defines services**
   ```
   web → cidadao-api
   worker → cidadao.ai-worker
   beat → cidadao.ai-beat
   ```

2. **railway.json provides global settings**
   - Build configuration
   - Restart policies
   - Shared across all services

3. **Service-specific settings in Railway Dashboard**
   - Health checks
   - Replicas
   - Resources (CPU/memory)

### Railway-Specific

1. **Procfile takes precedence** over railway.json startCommand
2. **$PORT is provided** by Railway (don't hardcode)
3. **DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL** auto-configured for managed services
4. **Only scale beat to 1 replica** (never more)
